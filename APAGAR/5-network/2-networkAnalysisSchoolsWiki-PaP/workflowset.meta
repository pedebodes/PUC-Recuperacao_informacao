  <met:element form="multiline" name="Comments">This workflow analysis schools Wikipedia (http://schools-wikipedia.org) using the network analysis plugin.
Schools Wikipedia is a subset of the English Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org) and contains more than 5000 articles.
Articles are represented as nodes in the network with the title of the article as node id.
Each of the main categories e.g. art, science, mathematics, etc. are represented by a partition in the network and nodes are assigned to their corresponding partitions.

The edges in the network represent hyperlinks of an article. Thus, each directed edge represents a hyperlink with the article that contains the hyperlink as source and the linked article as target node.

The workflow demonstrates some basic network analysis tasks such as network filtering, shortest path and connected component detection.</met:element>
